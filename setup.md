### simple linear regression

Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.
2 quantitative variables.

independent variables > 1 use multiple linear regression.

### Assumptions
Simple linear regression is a parametric test, meaning that it makes certain assumptions about the data. These assumptions are:

Homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity): the size of the error in our prediction doesn’t change significantly across the values of the independent variable.
Independence of observations: the observations in the dataset were collected using statistically valid sampling methods, and there are no hidden relationships among observations.
Normality: The data follows a normal distribution.
Linear regression makes one additional assumption:

The relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear: the line of best fit through the data points is a straight line (rather than a curve or some sort of grouping factor).

Simple linear regression formula
The formula for a simple linear regression is:

Simple linear regression formula
y is the predicted value of the dependent variable (y) for any given value of the independent variable (x).
B0 is the intercept, the predicted value of y when the x is 0.
B1 is the regression coefficient – how much we expect y to change as x increases.
x is the independent variable ( the variable we expect is influencing y).
e is the error of the estimate, or how much variation there is in our estimate of the regression coefficient.
